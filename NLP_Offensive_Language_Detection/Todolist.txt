RNN different length of sentences.
steps:
1. data pre processing(word embedding)(词干提取)
2. Word embedding to sentence matrix. (Use pytorch nn.)
3. 统一输入（CNN：三维；index输入: 两维）


problems:
1. different sentences have different lengths(different matrix size)
    solution1: project all the matrix to vector with same size.
    solution2: RNN, LSTM and transformer.

2. test set have the words not seen in training set

3. how to use offensive library


Further:
1. 同义词转换

have done:
remove dropout.
remove punctuation
